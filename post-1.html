                <h1>The Future of Minimalist Frameworks</h1>
                <p>In a world where web applications are becoming increasingly complex and heavy, there is a growing
                    movement towards minimalism. Micro frameworks like <strong>micro.ts</strong> are at the forefront of
                    this shift, proving that you don't need megabytes of JavaScript to create a fast, dynamic, and
                    engaging user experience.</p>

                <p>The philosophy is simple: use the browser's native capabilities whenever possible. Modern browsers
                    are incredibly powerful, and with just a few lines of clever code, we can achieve features like SPA
                    navigation, caching, and state management that once required massive libraries.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-40">Why Go Small?</h2>
                <p>Performance is the primary driver. By reducing the overhead, we improve load times, reduce battery
                    consumption on mobile devices, and provide a more responsive interface for everyone.</p>
